# PDC_A1: Speeding Up Matrix Multiplication

## Performance Comparison and Optimization üöÄ

### Processor Details
We utilized an Intel Core i5-7300U CPU @ 2.60GHz with 2 physical and 4 logical cores, 7.6 GiB of RAM, and an NVMe SSD. The processor supports SSE, AVX, AVX2, and FMA vector capabilities.

## Execution Times for Python, Java, and C
We tested a 1024x1024 matrix multiplication using Python, Java, and C:

- **Test case-3**: real 0m31.123s, user 0m6.774s, sys 0m0.310s

## Optimizations with Vector Instructions and Multi-threading
We implemented vector instructions and multi-threading in our C code to optimize performance:

### Vector Instructions
- **Test case-1**: real 0m56.667s, user 0m18.380s, sys 0m0.489s
- **Test case-2**: real 0m51.336s, user 0m18.584s, sys 0m0.505s
- **Test case-3**: real 0m27.126s, user 0m11.694s, sys 0m0.340s

### Multi-threading
- **Test case-1**: real 0m26.450s, user 0m11.713s, sys 0m0.340s
- **Test case-2**: real 0m26.980s, user 0m11.791s, sys 0m0.372s
- **Test case-3**: real 0m27.126s, user 0m11.694s, sys 0m0.340s

### Vector Instructions + Multi-threading
- **Test case-1**: real 0m27.861s, user 0m10.805s, sys 0m0.476s
- **Test case-2**: real 0m27.417s, user 0m10.588s, sys 0m0.580s
- **Test case-3**: real 0m28.166s, user 0m10.064s, sys 0m0.650s

## Insights and Learnings
This assignment provided valuable insights into the performance differences between serial and parallel computation using Python, Java, and C. Transitioning from Python to C resulted in significant speed-ups, further enhanced by multi-threading and vector instructions in C. Optimizing code with lower-level languages and parallel processing techniques can dramatically reduce execution times.

## How to Run
To execute the matrix multiplication:
- Python: `python3 runPythonBased.py`
- Java: `javac runJavaBased.java` followed by `java runJavaBased`
- C: Compile with `gcc -o a runCbased.c` and execute with `./a`
- C with multi-threading: Compile with `gcc -o a runCbased.c -pthread` and execute with `./a`
- C with vector instructions and multi-threading: Compile with `gcc -o a runVectorAndMultiCore.c -mavx -pthread` and execute with `./a`
